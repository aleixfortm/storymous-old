# storymous

**Storymous** is a story-based social media meant to deliver short and amazing stories. The front-end is fully responive, built without frameworks. The backend is supported by Flask, using Python. Users can log in and post their stories. An option will be added to add anonymous stories (here comes the 'mous' from storymous).

The link will soon be available.
